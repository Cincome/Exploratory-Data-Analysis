# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Repo for Exploratory Data Analysis class in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera

This repository is for the Exploratory Data Analysis class in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialzation given through Coursera.

Contained here are the two projects required for completion of this class.


# Project One

This project required writing four scripts that would exactly reproduce the plots provided in the instructions.  

The dataset used in this project is the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/"> UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a> and can be downloaded <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip"> here </a>. [20Mb]

The requirements for each plot were:

* Each plot had to be 480 by 480 pixels and saved as a PNG file.

* Plots had to be named 'Plot1.png', 'Plot2.png', 'Plot3.png', and 'Plot4.png'

* Create separate scripts to construct each plot.  The scripts had to read the data, as well as save the plot as a PNG file.

The example plots, project instructions, and code book can be found in the 'Original Plots and ReadMe' folder. The project repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1"> here</a>.

The plots created by me are found in the 'Project 1 Plots' folder and the scripts are found in the 'Project 1 Scripts' folder.



# Project Two

This project required analysis of a data set recording emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.  This data comes from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), which is maintained by the Enviromental Protection Agency (EPA).

The assignment required creating plots to answer six questions.  These questions are listed in the 'Project 2 Instructions'.

Each plot was required to be saved as a PNG file and have an individual script that would read the data, create the graph, and save the plot as in PNG file.

The Plots created for this assignment are found in 'Project 2 Plots' folder and the scripts are found in the 'Project 2 Scripts' folder.
