# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Repo for Exploratory Data Analysis class in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera

This repository is for the Exploratory Data Analysis class in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialzation given through Coursera.

Contained here are the two projects required for completion of this class.


# Project One

This project required writing four scripts that would exactly reproduce the plots provided in the instructions.  

The dataset used in this project is the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/"> UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a> and can be downloaded <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip"> here </a>. [20Mb]

The requirements for each plot were:

* Each plot had to be 480 by 480 pixels and saved as a PNG file.

* Plots had to be named 'Plot1.png', 'Plot2.png', 'Plot3.png', and 'Plot4.png'

* Create separate scripts to construct each plot.  The scripts had to read the data, as well as save the plot as a PNG file.

The original plots, project instructions, and code book can be found in the 'Original Plots and ReadMe' folder.

The plots created by me are found in the 'Project 1 Plots' folder and the scripts are found in the 'Project 1 Scripts' folder.
